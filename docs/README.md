# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation! This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for managing projects from initiation through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

These documents define how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, and integrations. Whether you're a Project Manager, Product Manager, Developer, or stakeholder, you'll find the guidance you need to understand our processes, roles, and best practices.

## Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

## Project Lifecycle

Our project management approach follows five key phases:

1. **Initiation** — Validate business need, align stakeholders, define success criteria
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate with regular team rhythm
4. **Release** — Deploy features with proper verification and rollback plans
5. **Close & Retrospective** — Capture learnings and identify improvements

## Documentation Guide

### Getting Started

Start here to understand the overall approach and key concepts:

- **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** — Core principles, roles, artifacts, and lifecycle overview

### Process Documents by Phase

Follow these guides through each phase of your project:

1. **[Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** — Define the problem, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan
2. **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** — Turn initiatives into actionable plans with prioritized backlogs
3. **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** — Manage day-to-day delivery with team rhythm and quality practices
4. **[Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** — Standardized release process to reduce risk and improve observability
5. **[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Supporting Resources

These documents provide additional guidance for ongoing project activities:

- **[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** — Identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies
- **[Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** — Understand responsibilities for Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers

## Quick Reference by Role

### For Project Managers (PM)
- Start with [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)
- Use [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) to kick off new projects
- Follow [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) for day-to-day delivery management
- Refer to [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) for stakeholder updates

### For Product Managers (PdM)
- Review [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) for the overall approach
- Use [Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md) to define success metrics
- Collaborate on [Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md) for backlog prioritization
- Check [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for responsibilities

### For Developers
- Understand your role in [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)
- Follow workflows in [Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)
- Review [Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) for release processes
- Participate in [Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)

## Using These Docs with Copilot Spaces

To enable Copilot Spaces to use these documents as context:
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` in your project repository
- Keep your Project Charter updated in the project repo
- Use persona definitions from [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) to shape role-specific guidance

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, you'll create and maintain:
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Communication Cadence

- **Weekly sync** between PM + PdM
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery team
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed
