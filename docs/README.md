# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for delivering successful projects through structured, repeatable processes.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach emphasizes **customer-first releases**, **clear roles and ownership**, **iterative improvements**, and **proactive risk management**. Our processes are designed to help cross-functional teams deliver value predictably and efficiently while fostering a culture of continuous learning and psychological safety.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has defined roles and accountability
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

## Core Project Management Processes

Our project lifecycle consists of six key phases that ensure structured delivery from concept to continuous improvement:

### 1. Initiation
Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project charter with success criteria and initial timeline. This phase answers "Should we do this?" and "What does success look like?"

### 2. Planning
Transform approved initiatives into actionable plans with prioritized backlogs, resource allocation, dependency mapping, and release timelines. Planning bridges strategy and execution.

### 3. Execution & Tracking
Manage day-to-day delivery through team rhythms (standups, syncs, demos), quality workflows, and progress tracking against milestones. This phase keeps work flowing and surfaces blockers early.

### 4. Release & Deployment
Deploy features to production safely with pre-release validation, smoke testing, rollback plans, and stakeholder communication. Standardized release processes reduce risk and improve reliability.

### 5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
Capture learnings after sprints, releases, or incidents, and convert them into actionable improvements. Retrospectives close the learning loop and drive incremental process enhancements.

### 6. Risk Management & Communication
Proactively identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks throughout the project lifecycle. Clear communication patterns keep stakeholders informed and aligned.
