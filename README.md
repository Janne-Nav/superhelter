## Team Superhelt: Get Started Quickly

If you're a member of Team Superhelt looking to use Copilot Spaces for onboarding and collaboration with the [navikt/historisk-superhelt](https://github.com/navikt/historisk-superhelt) repository:

- **[Quick Start Guide](docs/copilot-spaces-quick-start.md)** - Get up and running in 5 minutes
- **[Complete Onboarding Guide](docs/team-superhelt-onboarding-guide.md)** - Comprehensive guide for new team members

In this exercise, you will use Copilot Spaces:

1. Add a repository as a source to your Copilot Space
1. Add instructions to your Copilot Space
1. Create issues in the repository using Copilot Spaces
1. Explore and summarize project management process documentation
1. Update repository documentation based on insights and gaps discovered

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? 🤷</summary>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! 🐛
